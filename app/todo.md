# Ideas and Todo
- Make search load scenes like select2
  - Get search working
  - Create bindings to auto load results without refresh or redirect
    - (requires navigation logic to be functional).


- Pen plate or in-line editor
  - Integration with meta version of text.
  - Handle overlaps and rt editing.
  - Consider markup to metadata info (like github?).
